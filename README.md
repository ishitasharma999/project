# projectProject beneV is a community based project that serves as a bridge between the tech thinkers of today and the organisations working for human development
and human welfare. The greater idea would be to create a front end website serving the purpose of the community where people can put forward their ideas and our
thinkers can develop a real world tech resource for them. People can also contribute to this change bringer by making donations either to the organisation they
fancy or to the project their impulse is set to. We call the change bringers of tomorrow the benefactors.
This compiles the idea of the project benev.
